# Hello

Welcome to my Github profile :D

This repo is mainly an archive of my old projects. I am currently only actively working on a couple or so.

Anyways, I usually use `Rust`, `Bash`, and `Python` nowadays, but I learned to code with `HTML/CSS/JS` and dove headfirst into `Typescript` when I finally saw the light. I would still say my most proficient language is `Javascript/Typescript`, with `Bash` close behind.

Not that I like using Typescript for everything on the web, I find it annoying when I can't get something visual to work with CSS only.

I am currently learning Rust right now -- it takes a long time to write but it's Blazingly FastÂ®â„¢ðŸš€ðŸš€ at runtime and I appreciate that.

If you want to collaborate with me, just say the word. I am currently in college studying bio/cs so my time is limited.

My setup as of 2/17/23:
- OS: [Fedora 38](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/i3/)
- DE: [Hyprland on Wayland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), [i3wm on xorg](https://github.com/i3/i3)
- IDE: [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)

I have [public dotfiles](https://github.com/REALERvolker1/homescripts) too!

If you're still reading, you might enjoy following me. I also have Discord (`vlk#1000`). If you add me on Discord, please tell me you came from Github.
