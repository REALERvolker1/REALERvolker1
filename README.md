# Hello

Welcome to my Github profile :D

This repo is mainly an archive of my old projects. I am currently only actively working on a couple or so.

I learned to code with `HTML/CSS/JS` and dove headfirst into `Typescript` when I finally saw the light. I would say my most proficient "real" language is `Javascript/Typescript`.

Not that I like using Typescript for everything on the web, I find it annoying when I can't get something visual to work with CSS only.

I am currently learning Rust, zsh (alternative to bash), and perl.

If you want to collaborate with me, just say the word. I am currently in college studying bio/cs so my time is limited.

My setup as of 10/19/23:
- OS: [Fedora 38](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/i3/)
- DE: [Hyprland on Wayland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), [i3wm on xorg](https://github.com/i3/i3)
- IDE: [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)

I have [public dotfiles](https://github.com/REALERvolker1/homescripts) too. I write a lot of bash scripts, and I throw most of them into here.

If you're still reading, you might enjoy following me.
