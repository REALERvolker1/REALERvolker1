# Hello

Welcome to my Github profile :D

This repo is mainly an archive of my old projects. I am currently only actively working on a couple or so.

I learned to code with HTML/CSS/JS and eventually started making Discord bots with Typescript. I still love web dev, but I do not find these languages as useful as I once did.
After this, I tried out various other languages such as PHP, Java, and Julia (my first "hipster language").

I started learning Java in an OOP class, and during this time I took a cursory look at Minecraft modding. My biggest regret about this was that I did not ever follow through and finish a mod.

I learned PHP for a class I took, and through this experience I learned some valuable lessons about backend web development.
This is also one of the biggest reasons why I have never published my own website on my own server -- It just seems so hard to get it right!

I still quite enjoy writing shell scripts. There is something magical about being able to automate a great deal of tedious computer work with just a couple lines of `${(s..)${"$(<$i)"//$'\n'}}`.
I also believe that Perl is an underrated language.

I currently write a lot of Rust and C, since I do embedded programming. I also find Python useful for work, due to it being cross-platform.
I have learned that C is extremely clean, simple and efficient, until you start involving multiple people, on multiple days, doing multiple things.

I like Rust for many reasons! Not the least of which is that it allows me to do everything I would use a higher-level language for, but it strips out a lot of the "magic".

I have written a couple larger programs for Windows using C# in Visual Studio as well. Apparently, the customer is always right.

If you want to collaborate with me, just say the word. I am currently in college studying bio/cs so my time is limited.

My setup for FOSS development:
- OS: [Arch Linux (main)](https://archlinux.org/), [Fedora Linux (alt)](https://fedoraproject.org/spins)
- DE: [Hyprland on Wayland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), [i3wm on xorg](https://github.com/i3/i3)
- IDE: [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)

I have [public dotfiles](https://github.com/REALERvolker1/homescripts) too. I write a lot of bash scripts, and I throw most of them into here. I am quite proud of my setup.
